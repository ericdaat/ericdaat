Hi, Iâ€™m Eric, a Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer with additional Data Engineering and DevOps skills.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning applied to cancerology at the Curie Institute of Research in Paris, France. Besides work, I am really keen on music, photography, bike, karate and golf.
